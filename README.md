# Hi There üëã, I'm Aidan Mitchell

## Introduction
My name is Aidan Mitchell and I am currently a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara persuing a double major in Statistics & Data Science and Economics. I am eager to explore the intersection of these two fields and apply my technical and analytical skills to real-world problems. I have a love for data-driven decision making and am constantly looking for opportunities to learn from industry professionals and collaborate with peers to develop innovative solutions. I'm passionate about using data to make a positive impact and drive meaningful change!
